# JSON Utils
This asset is a one way bridge from JSON to Unity.
It implements many commonly used types, such as `Color`, `Gradient` etc., as well as some components, such as `Canvas`, `Text` etc.
You could even say that it does what UI Toolkit failed to do, allow users to define (UI) elements via text.

## Usage
This asset is not meant to be used on it's own, it depends on [TextUtils](https://github.com/nnra6864/TextUtils) from [NnUtils](https://github.com/nnra6864/NnUtils).
Therefore, I highly recommend just getting the entire [NnUtils](https://github.com/nnra6864/NnUtils) package([Instructions](https://github.com/nnra6864/NnUtils/blob/master/README.md#submodulerecommended)), or selectively installing [JSONUtils](github.com/nnra6864/JSONUtils) and [TextUtils](github.com/nnra6864/TextUtils)([Instructions](https://github.com/nnra6864/NnUtils/blob/master/README.md#submodulerecommended)).
