# User Define UI
This asset aims to allow for users to define simple UI, mostly for the needs of my other project, [Nisualizer](https://github.com/nnra6864/Nisualizer).
It does what the UI Toolkit is supposed to be able to do, load UI elements from a text file, but as usual with Unity, they failed to make a dececnt implementation :/
